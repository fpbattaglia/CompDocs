CONFIGURING NAS (Sinology) ACCESS
=================================


we have a Sinology NAS with 20TB storage. To access it from the cluster, it is good to have SFTP access. 

instructions for this may be found here (http://techanic.net/2014/04/12/configuring_ssh_and_scp_sftp_on_dsm_5.0_for_synology_diskstations.html) 

However, at the moment, it is not possible to do this from patron (probably because of firewall settings). I'm asking Ben Polman to help with that.
